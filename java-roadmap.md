# Java Mastery Plan

A structured roadmap to achieve complete mastery in Java — from absolute basics to advanced concepts — for Android development, backend systems, and competitive programming.

---

## 1. Core Java Foundations (Beginner → Intermediate)
> Goal: Build strong fundamentals that will never break, even in advanced topics.

### 1.1 Java Basics
- How Java works (JVM, JRE, JDK, compiler, interpreter)
- Basic syntax (main method, statements, semicolons, code structure)
- Variables & Data Types (int, double, char, String, boolean)
- Constants (final keyword)
- Type Casting & Type Conversion
- Operators:
  - Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
  - Relational (>, <, ==, !=)
  - Logical (&&, ||, !)
  - Assignment (=, +=, -=)
  - Unary & Ternary
- Input/Output:
  - Scanner class
  - System.out.print, System.out.println, System.out.printf

### 1.2 Control Flow
- Conditional statements (if, else if, else, switch)
- Loops:
  - for
  - while
  - do-while
  - Nested loops
- Break & Continue

---

## 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
> Goal: Understand and apply OOP principles for clean, modular, and scalable Java code.

### 2.1 Classes & Objects
- Declaring classes
- Creating objects using new
- Fields (instance & static variables)
- Methods:
  - Method parameters & return types
  - Method overloading
  - Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
- this keyword

### 2.2 Constructors
- Default constructors
- Parameterized constructors
- Constructor overloading
- this() constructor chaining

### 2.3 Inheritance
- extends keyword
- Method overriding
- super keyword
- Multilevel inheritance
- Constructor chaining in inheritance

### 2.4 Polymorphism
- Compile-time (method overloading)
- Runtime (method overriding)
- Upcasting & Downcasting

### 2.5 Abstraction
- Abstract classes & methods
- Interfaces
- Functional interfaces (Java 8+)

### 2.6 Encapsulation
- Private fields + getters/setters
- Immutability

---

## 3. Java Advanced Features
> Goal: Learn features that make Java powerful and production-ready.

### 3.1 Static & Final
- Static variables/methods
- Static blocks
- Final variables, methods, and classes

### 3.2 Inner & Nested Classes
- Static nested classes
- Member inner classes
- Local classes
- Anonymous inner classes

### 3.3 Packages & Imports
- Creating packages
- import keyword
- Access control with packages

### 3.4 Exception Handling
- Try-catch-finally
- Multiple catch blocks
- throw and throws
- Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
- Custom exceptions

### 3.5 Java Collections Framework
- List, Set, Map interfaces
- ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap
- Iterators & for-each loops
- Generics

### 3.6 File Handling
- Reading/writing files using:
  - FileReader, FileWriter
  - BufferedReader, BufferedWriter
  - FileInputStream, FileOutputStream
- Serialization & Deserialization

### 3.7 Java 8+ Features
- Lambda expressions
- Streams API
- Method references
- Optional class

---

## 4. Multithreading & Concurrency
> Goal: Handle parallel execution & improve performance.

- Creating threads (Thread class, Runnable interface)
- Thread lifecycle
- Synchronization
- wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
- Executor framework
- Concurrent collections (ConcurrentHashMap)

---

## 5. Design Patterns in Java
> Goal: Write clean, maintainable, and reusable code.

- Singleton
- Factory
- Builder
- Observer
- Strategy
- MVC architecture

---

## 6. Java for Android Development
> Goal: Apply Java skills directly to Android app creation.

- Android Studio setup with Java
- Activities & Fragments
- Intents
- RecyclerView & Adapters
- SQLite & Room Database
- SharedPreferences
- Networking with HttpURLConnection / Retrofit
- Background tasks with Services & WorkManager

---

## 📌 Learning Tips
- Daily Coding: Minimum 1 hour.
- Understand > Memorize: Focus on “why” before “how.”
- Revise Often: Java syntax is consistent, so review concepts weekly.
- Build While Learning: Don’t wait till the end to make projects.
