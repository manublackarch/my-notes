# Compare primary and reference types and Java Memory Model

## Primitive

- primitive types are java’s **most basic data types, that hold raw values** not objects
- they are **stored directly in memory (Stack)**
- as we know primitive types are `int` , `float` , `char` , `boolean` , etc.
- `==` is used to compare values
- comparison with this operator works fine, as primitive holds actual data, not the references

## Reference

- each primitive type has its wrapper type that are known as reference type in java
- reference types are referred to **objects stored in heap memory**
- reference type includes `String` , `Array` , `Object` , `Integer` , Wrapper classes, custom classes, etc.
- they do no store data directly, but **store a memory address (reference) to the object in the Heap memory**
- they are **slower than primitive** and can store `null`
- `==` compares only if both refer to the same memory
- `.isequal()` is used to actually compare content on the reference types

# Java Memory Model

- Java’s memory model defines how data is stored and accessed in memory during program execution
- understanding java memory model helps in preventing memory leaks (eg, avoid holding unnecessary references)
- It’s important for:
    - variable storage (`int x =5;`)
    - Object creation (`new Student()`)
    - comparing values (`== , isequal()`)

### Java has two main memory areas:

### 1. Stack memory

- it stores variables, method calls, primitive data types , object references (not the object itself) , etc
- **each thread has its own stack (one stack per thread)**
- very fast and automatically clean up after method ends

### 2. Heap memory

- it stores all objects created via new, arrays, string literals, etc
- it is **shared by all threads (all the threads use shared heap)**
- slower than stack
- garbage collected (java auto deletes unused heap objects)

## Integer Pool (Autoboxing Concept)

- java caches integers between `-128` to `127` to reuse
- so these values are stored in `a shared memory pool`
- comparing Integer objects the range with `==` may return `true`
- so its recommended to use `.isequals()` to compare of `Integer` value rather than using `==`

### Comparing arrays in java

- `arry1 == arry2` , this method **can never be used to compare arrays,** it mostly returns false , as it just compares reference
- `Arrays.equal(arry1,arry2)`  , this can be used for shallow value comparison like **comparison of 1D arrays**
- `Arrays.deepEquals(arry1,arry2)` ,  it’s used to **compare multi-dimensional arrays** those store value like matrix
