# Different types of classes

# Four types of Classes:

## 1. Concrete Class

- it is a **standard class in java** that can be instantiated to create objects
- most common type of class and it must provide an **implementation for all of its inherited or declared methods**
- an object can be directly created from a concrete class using `new` keyword

## 2. Abstract Class

- it is a **class that’s designed to be a blueprint** for other classes
- it is a method declared without a body, it acts as a **base class to be extended by other classes**
- `abstract` is a **modifier** used for **classes and methods**.
- When applied:
    - to a **class**, it means it **cannot be instantiated directly**.
    - to a **method**, it means it **has no body**, and **must be implemented in a subclass**.
- it can contain both fully implemented (concrete) and unimplemented (abstract) methods
- it **can’t be instantiated on its own,** meaning we **can’t directly create an object** from it using `new`

```java
abstract class Shape { //abstract class
    abstract void draw(); // abstract method (no body)

    void message() {       // concrete method (with body)
        System.out.println("This is a shape");
    }
}
//extended by other class
class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}
//about using abstract class, all methods can be used by extended class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s = new Circle(); // ✅ Can reference via abstract class
        s.draw();               // Output: Drawing a circle
        s.message();            // Output: This is a shape
    }
}
```

## 3. Final Class

- a final class is a **class that cannot be extended** (inherited)
- once a class is declared `final` , **no subclass can be created from it,** ensuring its implementation remains unchanged
- Final classes help create **immutable objects** (objects that cannot be changed after creation)

```java
final class Animal { //this class cannot be extended by other class now
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}
```

## 4. Nested Classes

- a nested class is a **class declared inside another class**
- used to logically group classes that are only used in one place, increase encapsulation, and make code more readable and maintainable
- Four types of nested classes, categorized into two groups:
    - Static nested class
    - Inner classes
        - Member inner class
        - Local inner class
        - Anonymous inner class

### 1. Static Nested Class

- declared with `static` keyword inside another class
- it is a member of it’s outer class, but isn’t tied to any instance of it
- **ACCESS:** it can only **access the static members** of its outer class directly. To access non-static members, it must first create an instance of the outer class
- **INSTANTIATION:** an instance can be created using the outer class name, like so:

```java
OuterClass.StaticNestedClass obj = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();
```

### 2. Inner Class

- non-static nested classes
- an instance of an inner class is always associated with an instance of its outer class
- three types:

### 2.1 Member Inner Class

- most common type of inner class, defined directly with outer class’s body
- ACCESS: full access to all members of the outer class, including private instances, variables and methods, because it exists with an instance of the outer class
- INSTANTIATION: we must first create an outer class object, then use that object to create an inner class instance:

```java
OuterClass outerObj = new OuterClass(); OuterClass.InnerClass innerObj = outerObj.new InnerClass();
```

### 2.2 Local Inner Class

- its defined inside a method or a block of code and its scope is limited to that method or block
- ACCESS: full access to all members of the outer class and can also access `final` or effectively `final` local variables of the method where it’s defined
- INSTANTIATION: can only be instantiated within the method or block where its defined

### 2.3 Anonymous Inner Class

- this class is declared without a name and instantiated in a single expression. It’s often used when we need to create a simple, one-time implementation of an interface or to extend a class
- ACCESS: can access all members of the outer class
- INSTANTIATION: created with new keyword, followed by an interface or class name, and a curly-braced block containing the class’s body:

```java
SomeInterface obj = new SomeInterface() { // class body };
```
