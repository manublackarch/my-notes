# Java Basics

## **Java helloWorld.java**

```java
public class helloWorld{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello world");
	}
}
```

- java is a case sensitive language
- `public class helloWorld`
    - in java everything starts with a class
    - ***class*** is like a container where our code lives in java
    - ***helloWorld***  is the name of the class and it should be same as of the java file
    - ***public*** means the class is accessible from anywhere in program
- `public static void main(String[] args){`
    - this line is a method its like the entry point of any java program, its mandatory as its where our program starts executing
    - ***public*** means this method is accessible to JVM(java virtual machine) from outside the class
    - ***static*** means this class belongs to the method itself, JVM can call its without creating any object
    - ***void*** means this method doesn’t returns any value
    - ***main*** is the name of the function, that JVM looks for to start execution
    - ***String[] args***  - this is an array of strings that stores cmmnd line arguments passed when the program is run
- `System.out.println(”Hello world”);`
    - this is the line that displays Hello world on screen
    - ***System*** is built-in java class that provides access to system resources
    - ***out***  -  a static member of system, it’s an object of PrintStream used to output data (*out = short for output*)
    - ***println()*** - method of `PrintStream` that prints a message to screen and moves cursor to new line
    - ***“Hello world”*** is the string to be printed on screen
- `{}`
    - curly braces are used in java to define blocks of code
    - the opening and closing braces wrap the class and the main method bodies

## **Comments in Java**

```java
/**
* This is a documentation comment 
* @author manu-blackarch
*/

public class JavaComments{
	public static void main(String[] args){

	 System.out.println("Comments in Java");
	 
	 //this is a single line comment
	 
	 /*
	 This is a multi-line comment
	 It can span multiple lines
	 Used for block-level explanations
	 */
	 

	}
}
```

- comments are kinda notes
    - written inside the code to explain what code does
    - to increase readability of code
    - make it understandable for your future self or for other developers
- comments are ignored by java compiler, so they don’t affect program’s output

### **Three types of comments:**

1. `//single line comment`  
    1. starts with //   
    2. anything after // is basically ignored by java compiler 
2. `/* Multi-line comment */`
    1. used to make multiple line comments 
3. `/** Documentation comment */`
    1. used to generate documentation using `javadoc` tool
    2. Javadoc comments allow tools to generate HTML documentation for your code
    3. usually placed above classes, methods or fields

## **Primitive data types**

these data types are most basic types of data, they store simple values directly in memory

### 1. Integer Type (whole numbers)

1. **byte (8-bit)**
    - smallest integer type
    - Range: -128 to 127
    - `byte age = 25;`
2. **short (16-bit)**
    - larger than byte, but shorter than int
    - Range: -32,768 to 32,767
    - `short year = 2025;`
3. **int (32-bit)**
    - most commonly used integer type
    - Range:  -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 (~ -2.1 billion to +2.1 billion)
    - `int salary = 50000;`
4. **long (64-bit)**
    - used for very large numbers
    - add `L` at the end of long intervals
    - `long population = 7800000000L;`

## 2. Floating Point Types (decimal numbers)

1. **float (32-bit)**
    - less precision (~7 decimal digits)
    - add `f` or `F` at the end
    - `float pi = 3.14f;`
2. **double (64-bit)**
    - most precision (~15 decimal digits)
    - default for decimal values
    - `double gravity = 9.80665;`

## 3. Character Type

1. char (16-bit)
    - stores a single character as unicode
    - use single quotes
    - `char grade = 'A';`

## 4. Boolean Type

1. bool (1-bit, logical type)
    - can only store true or false
    - `boolean JavaFun = true`

## **Number Systems**

```java
int dec = 152;
int bin = 0b10011000;
int oct = 0230;
int hex = 0x98;
```

Radix = base, basically used for converting numbers from one number system to another

### 1. Binary Number System

- radix is 2
- 0,1

```java
3   2   1   0
1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |   radix is 2
1*(2**3) + 0*(2**2) + 1*(2**1) + 1*(2**0)
8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 in decimal system
```

### 2. Octal Number System

- radix is 8
- 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7

```java
3   2   1   0
7 | 2 | 0 | 5 | radix is 8
7*(8**3) + 2*(8**2) + 7*(0**1) + 7*(5**0)
3584 + 128 + 0 + 5 = 3717 in decimal system
```

### 3. Hexadecimal System

- radix is 16
- 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F

```java
3   2   1   0
1 | 3 | A | E | radix is 16
1*(16**3) + 2*(16**2) + 10*(1**1) + 14*(16**0)
4096 + 768 + 160 + 14 = 5038 in decimal system
```
