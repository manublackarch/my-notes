# Iteration Statements (loops) in Java

- loops lets us execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition
- java supports several looping constructs

## `while` loop

- executes a **loop as long as condition is true**
- **condition** for loop is **checked before** block of code is executed
- `while` loop syntax:

```java
while (condition) {
    // code block
}
```

## `do-while` loop

- **executes block at least once,** **doesn’t matters condition is true or not for first time**
- then, **goes for execution while condition is true**
- here condition is checked after execution
- do-while loop syntax:

```java
do {
    // code block
} while (condition);
```

## `for` loop

- best when **number of iterations** is known
- it has **initialization, condition, and update** in one line
- `for` loop syntax with example:

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code block
}

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

## Enhanced `for-each` loop

- used for iteration over arrays and collections
- it doesn’t need any index
- `for-each` syntax with example:

```java
for (dataType var : collection) {
    // code block
}

int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
```

## Nested loops

- a loop inside another loop
- very common in matrix problems, pattern printing,etc

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 2; j++) {
        System.out.println("i=" + i + ", j=" + j);
    }
}
```

## Jump Statements

- its used to control loop manually to change the flow of logic
- `break` statement
    - it exits the loop immediately
- `continue` statement
    - skips the current iteration and moves on to next
- `return` statement
    - used to exit from the method, ends loop (if inside method)

## Label

- `label` is any **identifier** used before a loop or block of code followed with a `:`
- it allows us to apply `break` or `continue` to outer loops in nested loops - instead of affecting only the innermost one
- java labels are not like `GOTO` statements - they don’t jump anywhere; they just help control loop flow more precisely
- why use labels:
    - in nested loops, if we have to break out of like 1st loop, it is tricky as `break` or `continue` only works in the innermost loop and won’t affect the outer loops
    - so we use label especially in nested loops so that we can control outer loops
- `label` syntax:

```java
labelName:
for (...) {
    // inner code
}
//break labelName; → exits the labeled loop completely
//continue labelName; → jumps to the next iteration of the labeled loop
```
