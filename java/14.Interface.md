# Interface

- an interface in java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only **abstract, default, private, static methods and constants**
- it defines a **contract that a class must implement** - it does not contain implementation itself unless default or static methods are used in it
- it’s kind of a blueprint - **Any class that says it implements this interface must provide definitions for all methods in the interface**
- we don’t need to type `public` and `abstract` keyword with abstract methods in interface as methods are always `public` and `abstract` by default in a interface

## Syntax of the interface

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();     // abstract method
    void stop();      // abstract method
}
```

Any class implementing the above interface must provide method definitions:

```java
class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting...");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car is stopping...");
    }
}
```

### Multiple Inheritances

- unlike abstract classes and concrete classes which have single inheritance, **Interface have multiple inheritance** in java

```java
interface Camera { //interface 1
    void takePhoto();
}

interface MusicPlayer { //interface 2
    void playMusic();
}

class SmartPhone implements Camera, MusicPlayer {  //multiple interface inheritance
    public void takePhoto() { System.out.println("Click!"); }
    public void playMusic() { System.out.println("Playing music"); }
}
```

## Creating interface in a separate file

```java
// File: Animal.java
public interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}
```

Using interface in another file:

```java
// File: Dog.java
public class Dog implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof Woof");
    }
}
```
