# Methods

- a method in java is a block of code that performs a specific task
- just like a function in python, but it must belongs to a class
- java is an OOP language, so all methods are defined inside classes or objects

### Syntax of a method:

```css
modifier returnType methodName(parameterList) {
    // method body
}
```

## Parts of a method:

### modifier

- **access modifiers** controls who can **call the method,** five types:
- `public` : can be accessed from **anywhere**
- `private` : can be only accessed in the **same class**
- `protected` : accessible in **same package or subclass**
- `default` : (no keyword used), accessible in **same package only**

### returnType

- it determines what **type of data method will return**
- `void` : means nothing will return
- we can set any data type to be returned like: `String` , `int` , `double` , `boolean` , etc

### methodName

- as name says, it is used to define method name
- method name in java is written in camel case eg. `eatChips()`

### parameter list

- parameters are the **data values that are given as input** to method
- it is used to give single or multiple data to method for processing

## To call a method:

- method can be simply called to print something on screen like: `methodName();`
- or method can be used to store data value in variable like: `int c = methodSum(1,2);`

## Method Signature

- method signature is simply the **combination of method’s name, and its parameters list** (including the number, type and order of parameters)
- method signature does not contains access modifier and return type, just simply method’s name and its parameter
- eg. **method** → `public int addIntegers(int a, int b){ method body}`
    - **method signature** → `addIntegers(int a, int b)`

## Method Overloading

- method overloading is creating multiple methods with same name, as long as:
- Different number of parameters, or different types of parameter

```css
#example
void display(String s) {
    System.out.println(s);
}
void display(int x) {
    System.out.println(x);
}
```

## Method Recursion

- recursion means calling method inside method to solve some kind of problem
- very important to define recursion ending condition

example:

```css
int factorial(int n) {
    if(n == 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

# Parameter Passing mechanism

## Pass-by-Value

- in java, methods **receive a copy of the variable** whenever we pass the value
- the original value outside the method is **never modified directly,** until and unless we don’t return that value from method
- this applies to both primitive and references - Java is strictly pass-by-value nature only

### 1. Passing primitive types to methods

- when we pass primitive data type, **a copy of that variable’s data value is passed** so it **changes the copy and the original variable data remains unchanged**
- as we remember primitive type is stored in stack and each thread has its own stack

### 2. Passing reference types to methods

- when we pass reference data type, a copy of the reference pointing to the same memory address in heap is passed to the method so when we **change the *object's contents* through the copy of the reference. Original *object's contents* are changed.**
- but when we ***reassign the copied reference* to a *new object*. Original reference remains unchanged.**

## Varargs (Variable-Length Arguments)

- this feature in java helps us to **accept zero or multiple arguments** of specific data type
- its like being able to pass a varying number of items to method without having to explicitly creating a array yourself beforehand
- varargs parameters are **declared** by using **an ellipsis**(`...`) after the data type in front of method’s parameter list
- varargs syntax: `dataType... variableName`

### Key rules for varargs:

- **zero or more arguments** : by using varargs we can take zero or multiple arguments
- treated as an array : inside method, varargs will be treated as an array, this means we can iterate over it using foreach loop and access its elements using index
- **last parameter only** : each method can have only **one varargs parameter,** and if there are multiple parameters to the function the varargs parameter will always be at the last in the parameters list in method
- **ambiguity** : while using varargs with method overloading can sometimes confuse compiler, so better be careful while using varargs with method overloading or better be avoiding it
- **passing an array** : we can explicitly simply pass an array also to the method
