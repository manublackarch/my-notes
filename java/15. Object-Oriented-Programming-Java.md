# Object-Oriented Programming Java

## What is OOP

- a programming paradigm where we model real-world entities as **objects that contains state (fields) and behavior (methods)**
- OOP is a programming model that **organizes software design around the objects**, rather than functions
- Java is designed as an OOP language; **everything lives inside a class**

## OOP vs Functional programming

### OOP

- OOPs is all about **state and mutable objects**
- class and the object are the primary unit, we define a **blueprint (class)** and creates **instances (objects)** from it
- mutable objects are common part of the style, as their **internal data can be changed after creation**
- **code is reused** through inheritance and polymorphism
- common side effect of OOP is, often **methods modify the object’s state or the surrounding environment**

### Functional programming

- Functional programming focuses on **data and immutable data**
- functions are the primary unit, and **data flows from one function to next in a pipeline**
- immutable data is the norm, if we need to change something, we create a new, modified piece of data
- code is reused through **function composition and higher-order functions**
- side effects are highly discouraged, as the goal is to use pure functions that always produce the same output for the given input without changing anything else

## Advantages of OOP

- it provides modularity as **programs are broken into self-contained objects,** which make them easier to manage
- it increase **scalability to add new features by creating new objects,** allowing for easier growth
- objects can be reused across different parts of a projects or in new objects, thus increasing reusability of code
- **encapsulation hides internal structure** as data and logic is hidden within objects, showing only what’s necessary, improving security and reliability
- modular structure makes **debugging and maintenance more efficient**
- inheritance and polymorphism allow for **flexible code design and extension**

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) has four main pillars:

### 1. Inheritance

### 2. Polymorphism

### 3. Encapsulation

### 4. Abstraction
