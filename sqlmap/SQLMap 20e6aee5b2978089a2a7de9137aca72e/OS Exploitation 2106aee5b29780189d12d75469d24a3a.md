# OS Exploitation

- to be able to read/write on the hosting server we need to check if we have dba privileges
- `--is-dba` : to check for dba privilege

### Read

- `--file-read “/etc/passwd”` : to read file using sqlmap

### Write

- `--file-write “content_of_file_to_be_written” --file-dest “path/where/to/save/file”` : file write flag can be used to write content on the hosting server and file destination flag can be used to save file in the desired location

### OS command execution

- once we confirm we have read/write privilege (dba privilege) on the hosting server then we can use sqlmap feature to give us any easy OS shell without writing whole script
- `--os-shell` : flag used to execute commands on hosting server
