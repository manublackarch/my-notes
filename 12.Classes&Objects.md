# Classes & Objects

## Fields (a.k.a. Instance Variables)

- fields holds the state of an object
- each object has its own copy of non-static fields
- fields can be accessible within the class, and their access level can be `private`, `public` or `protected`

```java
public class Person {
    String name;   // field
    int age;       // field
}
```

## Initialization blocks

- Initialization blocks are code blocks that are used to execute statements during the creation of an objects or class
- they are directly places inside class body, outside of any method or constructor
- Java has two types of Initialization blocks:

### 1. Instance Initialization Block (IIB)

- it runs every time an object is created, right before the constructor
- we can have multiple instance blocks, and they run in the order they appear in the class

```java
public class Example {
    private String name;
    
    // Instance Initialization Block
    {
        System.out.println("Instance block is running.");
        this.name = "Default Name";
    }

    public Example() {
        System.out.println("No-arg constructor is running.");
    }
}
```

### 2. Static Initialization Block

- runs once when class is **loaded into memory** (before `main()` or object creation)
- it used to initialize `static` fields

```java
public class Config {
    static int setting;
    static {
        setting = 42;
        System.out.println("Static block executed");
    }
}
```

## Constructors

- a special method which is used **to initialize an object** when its created
- its automatically called **only once,** whenever we use `new` keyword to instantiate a class
- Constructors can be **overloaded by different parameters list** (different numbers, types or orders of parameters)
- types of constructors:
    - **No-argument constructor:** no parameters, useful for creating objects with default values
    - **Parameterized constructor:** takes one or more parameters, used to initialize an object with specific values provided at the time of creation

```java
public class Circle {
    double radius;
    
    // Parameterized constructor
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    
    //No-argument constructor
    publice Circle(){
	    System.out.println("wazup people!");
    }
}

// How it's used:
Circle myCircle = new Circle(10.5); 
System.out.println(myCircle.radius); // Output: 10.5
```

## Methods

- method in java is a block of code that **performs a specific task**
- it defines **behavior (function)** of the class
- methods can **access or modify** fields
- Java supports **methods overloading** (same name, but different parameters)
- **#notes about methods already made**

## Getters and Setters

- getters and setters are methods used in java to access and modify the private variables of a class
- they are core part of encapsulation, a fundamental part of OOP that protects an object’s internal state

### Getters (Accessor Methods)

- its a method that **retrieves the value of a private variable**
- it allows **other parts of program to read an object’s state** without directly accessing its data
- a getter method usually has the **prefix:** `get`

```java
public class Product {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

### Setters (Mutator Methods)

- it is a method that **changes the value of a private variable**
- they provide a **controlled way to modify an object’s state** and can include logic validate the new value before assigning it
- a setter method usually has the **prefix:** `set`

```java
public class Product {
    private double price;

    public void setPrice(double newPrice) {
        if (newPrice > 0) { // Validation logic
            this.price = newPrice;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Price cannot be negative.");
        }
    }
}
```

## `toString()` Method

- its a special method in java that returns a string representation of an object
- it is simply triggered whenever we simply tries to **print our object**
- fundamental part of `java.lang.Object` class, so every class in java inherits it by default
- the default implementation of toString() method in the Object Class isn’t very useful as it returns the **object's class name and a hexadecimal representation of its memory address,** which isn't human-readable
- to get a **meaningful string representation of our objects,** we should override the `toString()` method in our own class and by doing this we can return a string that contains the value of the object’s instance variables:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

		//constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Overriding the toString() method to provide a meaningful output
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person [name=" + name + ", age=" + age + "]";
    }
}

//now when we print our object created from that class, we get a meaningfull string
//like the object's instance variables
public static void main(String[] args){
	Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
  System.out.println(person); 
  // Output: Person [name=Alice, age=30]
}

```

## to create an object

- `new` keyword is used to create an Object from a Class in Java
- **Declaration:** a *variable declared* of the class type: `Car myCar;`
- **Instantiation:** `new` keyword is used to allocate memory for a new object: `new Car;`
- **Initialization:** constructor is called to initialize the newly created object: `new Car;`
- **Combining the above steps into a single line of code to create an object:** `ClassName objectName = new ClassName();`
- and if the class has parameterized constructors, we pass the values accordingly inside the parentheses
